# Program Blocks

This directory contains documentation for various program blocks:

- Function Blocks (FB)
- Functions (FC)
- Data Blocks (DB) - Global, Instance, and SCADA
- Organization Blocks (OB)
- Tool Function Blocks (TB) and Tool Functions (TC)
- Safety blocks

## Documentation Organization

The documentation is organized in several ways:

1. **By Block Type**: Each type of program block has its own directory with specific documentation:
   - [Function Blocks](./function-blocks/)
   - [Functions](./functions/)
   - [Data Blocks](./data-blocks/)
   - [Organization Blocks](./organization-blocks/)
   - [Tool Blocks](./tool-blocks/)
   - [Safety Blocks](./safety/)

2. **Combined Documentation**: For easier access to all program blocks in one set of files, see the [combined](./combined/) directory, which contains the complete documentation split into manageable parts.

## Recommended Approach

For a comprehensive view of all program blocks, we recommend using the combined documentation in the [combined](./combined/) directory, as it provides the full context of the TIA Portal project. The individual block type directories are useful for focused reference on specific block types.
