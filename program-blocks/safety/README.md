## Notes

Safety blocks are crucial components in TIA Portal projects that ensure the system operates safely and can respond appropriately to hazardous conditions. These documents cover:

1. **Safety Administration**: Configuration, settings, and management of safety systems.
2. **Safety Blocks**: Program blocks specifically designed for safety-critical applications.

These safety components are designed to meet specific safety integrity levels (SIL) requirements and comply with industry safety standards.
